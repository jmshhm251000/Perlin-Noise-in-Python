# Perlin Fractal Noise in Python

Hi, I've coded a perlin fractal noise generator using python's pygame and few other libraries.

Requirements.txt contains the libraries I used to generate the noise.
If you are a lazy person like me just type below in the terminal.
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

I tried to optimize the code to reduce the noise calculation time, but the best I've got it down was about 0.2 second.
Anyways, I hope it's useful to anyone interested.
